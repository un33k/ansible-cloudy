# Vault Configuration Directory

This directory contains Ansible Vault files with sensitive credentials and configuration.

## How Vault Loading Works

Ansible automatically loads vault variables using the standard `group_vars` structure:

- **Development**: `cloudy/inventory/group_vars/all/vault.yml` → symlinks to `.secrets/dev.yml`
- **Staging**: Create `cloudy/inventory/group_vars/all/vault_staging.yml` → symlinks to `.secrets/staging.yml`
- **Production**: Create `cloudy/inventory/group_vars/all/vault_prod.yml` → symlinks to `.secrets/production.yml`

## Environment Setup

### Development Environment
```bash
# 1. Create your dev vault from template
cp .secrets/vault.yml.template .secrets/dev.yml

# 2. Edit with your development credentials
vim .secrets/dev.yml

# 3. Encrypt the vault file
ansible-vault encrypt .secrets/dev.yml

# 4. Vault is automatically loaded via symlink
ansible-playbook -i cloudy/inventory/test.yml [your-playbook] --ask-vault-pass
```

### Staging Environment
```bash
# 1. Create your staging vault from template
cp .secrets/staging.yml.template .secrets/staging.yml

# 2. Edit with your staging credentials
vim .secrets/staging.yml

# 3. Encrypt the vault file
ansible-vault encrypt .secrets/staging.yml

# 4. Create symlink for staging inventory
ln -s ../../../../.secrets/staging.yml cloudy/inventory/group_vars/all/vault_staging.yml

# 5. Use staging inventory
ansible-playbook -i cloudy/inventory/staging.yml [your-playbook] --ask-vault-pass
```

### Production Environment
```bash
# 1. Create your production vault from template
cp .secrets/production.yml.template .secrets/production.yml

# 2. Edit with your production credentials (use strong passwords!)
vim .secrets/production.yml

# 3. Encrypt the vault file
ansible-vault encrypt .secrets/production.yml

# 4. Create symlink for production inventory
ln -s ../../../../.secrets/production.yml cloudy/inventory/group_vars/all/vault_prod.yml

# 5. Use production inventory
ansible-playbook -i cloudy/inventory/production.yml [your-playbook] --ask-vault-pass
```

## Vault Variables

All vault variables use the `vault_` prefix and have fallback defaults in inventory files:

- `vault_admin_user` → fallback: `admin`
- `vault_ssh_port` → fallback: `22022`
- `vault_git_user_full_name` → fallback: `John Doe`
- `vault_timezone` → fallback: `America/New_York`

## Security Notes

- ✅ **Encrypted at rest**: All vault files should be encrypted with `ansible-vault encrypt`
- ✅ **Safe to commit**: Encrypted vault files are safe to commit to git
- ✅ **Environment separation**: Separate vault files for dev/staging/production
- ⚠️ **Password protection**: Always use `--ask-vault-pass` or set `ANSIBLE_VAULT_PASSWORD_FILE`

## Vault Password Setup (Required for Seamless Workflow)

Set up the `ANSIBLE_VAULT_PASSWORD_FILE` environment variable to avoid manual password prompts:

```bash
# 1. Create vault password file (secure location)
echo "your_vault_password" > ~/.ansible-vault-pass
chmod 600 ~/.ansible-vault-pass

# 2. Set environment variable (add to ~/.bashrc or ~/.zshrc)
export ANSIBLE_VAULT_PASSWORD_FILE=~/.ansible-vault-pass

# 3. Reload your shell or run:
source ~/.bashrc  # or ~/.zshrc
```

**Security Notes**: 
- ✅ Use a strong, unique password for your vault
- ✅ File should have restricted permissions (600)
- ✅ Store in your home directory, NOT in the project
- ⚠️ Add the export to your shell profile for persistence

## Smart Development Workflow (Recommended)

The git hooks provide a seamless development experience:

```bash
# 1. Edit vault files directly (unencrypted for fast development)
vim .secrets/dev.yml

# 2. Commit changes normally (warns but allows unencrypted files)
git add .secrets/dev.yml
git commit -m "Update vault configuration"

# 3. Push automatically encrypts, pushes, then decrypts back
git push origin main
# → Auto-encrypts .secrets/dev.yml (using your ~/.ansible-vault-pass)
# → Commits encrypted version  
# → Pushes to remote safely
# → Decrypts back to .secrets/dev.yml for continued development
```

**Password Handling:**
- ✅ **Automatic**: Uses `$ANSIBLE_VAULT_PASSWORD_FILE` (no prompts)
- ⚠️ **Manual**: Prompts for password if `ANSIBLE_VAULT_PASSWORD_FILE` not set
- 💡 **Setup Help**: Hook provides helpful setup instructions if missing

## Manual Vault Commands (Alternative)

```bash
# Edit encrypted vault
ansible-vault edit .secrets/dev.yml

# View encrypted vault (read-only)
ansible-vault view .secrets/dev.yml

# Change vault password
ansible-vault rekey .secrets/dev.yml

# Manual encrypt/decrypt cycle
ansible-vault decrypt .secrets/dev.yml  # Edit in IDE
# ... make changes ...
ansible-vault encrypt .secrets/dev.yml  # Re-encrypt
```

## Git Hook Installation

```bash
# Install the smart workflow hooks
./.githooks/install-hooks.sh
```
