# Ensure Secure Connection - Connection Validation Task
# Validates that the current connection is using root user with SSH keys
# This task should be included in all service recipes to ensure proper authentication
# Note: Skip validation for security_targets group which uses password auth

    msg: |
      ❌ SECURITY ERROR: Not connected as root user!
      
      This recipe requires root user connection with SSH keys.
      
      Root access is required for service operations.
      
      Expected: ansible_user should be 'root'
      Actual: ansible_user is '{{ ansible_user }}'
      
      🔧 Fix:
      1. Run hardening first: ./cli harden --install
      2. Then run security setup: ./cli security --install
      3. Ensure you're targeting 'service_targets' group with root user
  when: ansible_user != 'root'

  fail:
    msg: |
      ❌ AUTHENTICATION ERROR: Password authentication detected!
      
      This recipe requires SSH key authentication only.
      
      Root user should only use SSH key authentication.
      
      🔧 Fix:
      1. Remove ansible_ssh_pass from inventory
      2. Ensure SSH keys are installed: ./cli security --install
      3. Use SSH key authentication only
  when: ansible_ssh_pass is defined and 'security_targets' not in group_names

# Port check removed - now using single vault_ssh_port variable
# Users can change ports with cli harden --from-port X --to-port Y if desired

      🔧 Fix:

      🔧 Fix:
      1. Run security setup: ./cli security --install
      2. Verify sudoers configuration is correct
  when: sudo_test.rc != 0 or sudo_test.stdout != 'root'
