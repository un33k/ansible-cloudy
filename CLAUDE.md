# Ansible Cloudy - Migration Project

## Project Overview
Migration from Python Fabric-based automation to Ansible + Docker framework targeting Debian-based Linux servers.

## Architecture Philosophy
**Atomic → Composed → Recipes**
- **Atomic Roles**: Single-purpose, reusable components
- **Composed Playbooks**: Multi-role orchestration
- **Complete Recipes**: Full-stack solutions

## Development Notes
- Target OS: Debian-based Linux servers
- Each role does one thing well
- Docker variants for different server flavors
- Modular and scalable design

## Implementation Status
- [x] Project structure planning
- [ ] Core directory structure
- [ ] Foundational atomic roles
- [ ] Docker configurations
- [ ] Development tooling
